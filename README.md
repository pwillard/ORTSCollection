# ORTSCollection
A Blender Collection tool to setup and swap collections

Initial TEST release

This add-on will perform the initial steps of creating the Collection heirarchy needed for exporting MSTS/ORTS  shape files.

Swapping collections is helpful when needing to export specific parts of a model, such as applied decals, separately as .S files.

You would, for example, move the decal related meshes to the scratchpad collection and the use the SWAP option to make only those items exist under the MAIN collection and everything else now resides under the renamed Scratchpad, allowing you to export just the items under MAIN.
